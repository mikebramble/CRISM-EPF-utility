## CRISM-MATLAB-utilities
A suite of MATLAB tools for the ingestion, processing, and display of hyperspectral data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM).

## THIS IS AN EVOLVING REPOSITORY
I aim to upload new scripts every couple of weeks.

Below are descriptions of the scripts in this repository and explanations of how to use them:

## function_pdslblread

A MATLAB function to ingest PDS LBL file data into a structure of varaibles and parameters.

## script_subset_crism_image

A MATLAB function to perform a spatil subset of a CRISM image and export it to and IMG file with HDR header file.

## SCRIPT_NAME
